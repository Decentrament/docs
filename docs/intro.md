# What is Decentrament?

Decentrament is a decentralized autonomous venture capital (VC). Where Web3 projects get funded by the community instead of a centralized VC aiming to collect some profit. We are building a community of long-term supporters. We are simply giving you the capital you need with the best community to achieve your goals and decentralize the world.

We are solving the biggest problem the Web3 is facing now, which is addressed by [Jack Dorsey](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473139010197508098?s=20):

You don’t own “web3.”

The VCs and their LPs do. It will never escape their incentives. It’s ultimately a centralized entity with a different label.
